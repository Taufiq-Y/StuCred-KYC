# Welcome to my KYC Repository.
Lets take a look, On how to setup the code base.

- Begin by utilizing the "git clone" command to clone my repository to your preferred location.
- Next, navigate to the backend folder and run the command "npm install." Repeat this step for the frontend folder.r.
- Be prepared for a potential wait, as the installation duration depends on your system's performance.
- Once you observe the installed modules, navigate to those folders and launch the terminal.
- Execute "npm start" in both terminals and patiently wait for a few moments. Voila! ðŸš€ You have successfully initialized and compiled the code on your machine.

## _Prepare the coffee quickly....We have lot to explore !_

This KYC application incorporates functionalities for capturing audio, video, and images. The application is developed using plain JavaScript and React, without the use of any software development kits (SDKs).

### Features.

- Audio, Video & Image Processing.
- Pagination & sorting
- Authentication Guard.

## Features
# 1. Audio, Video & Image Processing.
        This is build using javascript and react without any SDks. Users have the capability to capture a photograph of themselves and record their appearance or voice, facilitating the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process by saving and use it for later.
        
# 2. Pagination & Sorting.
        Pagination and sorting functionalities have been seamlessly integrated into the backend, streamlining the process of fetching and organizing data efficiently. **This approach enhances overall performance by reducing the data load transferred to the frontend**, resulting in faster rendering times. The backend's management of pagination and sorting also ensures a more responsive and scalable application, promoting an improved user experience.
        
# 3. Authentication Guard.
        JWT has been successfully implemented within the application, providing a secure means of authentication. Additionally, a middleware has been created to safeguard specific routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them. This robust combination enhances the overall security posture of the system.
        For Example: Get Users Route.
        
# 4. Users
        The Login and Register functionalities have been developed, incorporating robust validation measures to ensure data integrity. Additionally, a token-based authentication mechanism has been implemented to enhance security, providing a secure and seamless experience for users during the authentication processes.
